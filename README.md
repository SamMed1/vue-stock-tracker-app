## Shut up and tell me what it does!
It's a UI that enables you to grab information on stocks, on the fly.

If you've got some cash invested, and you want to see how it's doing, instead of going through an annoying, 100-step security verification process to see how your investment is doing, just select your stock, add in some info, et Voila.

It uses the banging [Marketstack](https://marketstack.com/) API, and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) loaded via modules, for the front-end.

This is an ongoing project, so don't moan if I've forgotten to indent something :)
